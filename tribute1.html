      <h2>Mother of the nuclear Bomb</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>A wickedly smart woman, who was dubbed “mother of the nuclear bomb", and
        who had her Noble prize taken away from her by male colleagues simply
        because she was a Jewish woman. The man who did get it? Otto Hahn. Lise
        discovered the element protactinium, which you know, is a pretty big
        deal. Now, while she did work with Otto to discover nuclear fission and
        protactinium, she never received any credit for her work from the Nobel
        committee. In fact, she was nominated 49 times, and they still failed to
        realize how much she actually contributed. Because she was alive during
        WW2, she eventually had to flee Austria, and settle in Sweden. She never
        returned. Called the “German Marie Curie" by Albert Einstein, Lise's
        work in radioactivity and nuclear physics is still unknown to many.</h3>

      <p><h3>
        Lise Meitner is another researcher who it’s often argued should have
        shared in the Nobel Prize for the discovery of nuclear fission. With
        Otto Hahn, she led the research group that also included Fritz
        Strassmann, having become the first woman in Germany to become a full
        professor in physics in 1926. But following Hitler’s rise to power, her
        position as an Austrian Jew became increasingly precarious, and in 1938
        she fled to Sweden, ultimately becoming a Swedish citizen. That meant
        that when Hahn and Strassman were carrying out the experiments that
        would provide evidence for nuclear fission in December 1938, Meitner
        could only contribute through correspondence by letter. When Hahn won
        the Nobel Prize, Meitner agreed it was deserved. It was only when the
        Nobel Committee’s deliberations were revealed in the 1990s that it
        became clear how much Meitner had been overlooked; the Committee had not
        understood her contribution, and Meitner had received more nominations
        than Hahn. Hahn himself appears to have been aware of the injustice: he
        nominated Meitner for a Nobel Prize multiple times in subsequent years,
        but she never won.</h3>
